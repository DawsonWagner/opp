objectives:
  - identify discrimination at level of individual (not average)
  - identify discrimination in discounting speed by race when stopped for same speed
conclusions:
  - white drivers are 6% more likely to be discounted by lenient officers (base
    of 45%), due to minorities being treated less leniently for speeds from 12
    to 25 MPH over
  - an officer in the 90th percentile is twice as likely to discount a white
    driver as a minority driver
  - 40% of officers explain the entirety of aggregate disparity
  - minority and female officers practice less discrimination
  - a large share of disparity is due to minorities driving in areas where
    officers are less lenient to all motorists
  - firing ineffective; best solution is to reallocate lenient officers
todo:
  - histogram of 'over' speed separated by majority/minority
  - identify control group (those who have no bunching) - this also gives
    'true' distribution of speeds; paper uses officers with fewer than 2% of
    tickets at 9 MPH over
  - breakdown table of summary statistics (pct of each race, age, etc)
  - breakdown of cops that ticket at various price points
  - p. 49, lenient vs non-lenient histograms by race (Figure 7, p49)
  - linear model (per officer):
    S_ij = B_0 + B_1*White_i + B_2*Lenient_j + B_3*White_i*Lenient_j +
    X_ij\gamma + epsilon_ij
  - B_3 reflects how much more likely a white driver benefits from encountering
    a lenient officer
  - Cov(Lenient_j, e_ij) must = 0; meaning officers do not systematically
    differ in the characeristics of drivers to whom they stop/give a warning
  - get fee schedules by location
  - remove stops not on a road (if geolocation present)
facts:
  - officers exercise discretion through either a warning or discounting
  - 9 MPH is the decision point, since most officers don't stop before speeds
    less than 10 over, this suggests discounting (non-lenient officers have
    virtually no tickets at the speed)
  - they have 1.14M citations (fitlered from 2.1M) over 10-year period
  - discounting components: speeding and discrimination
  - F_r(x_i): probability of observing speed x with race r
  - P_j(x,r(i)): probability of officer j discounting speed x when evaluating
    motorist i with race r(i)
  - Pr(X_i = x_d|i,j) = F_r(i)(x_d) + \sum_{k>x_d}F_r(i)(k)*P_j(x, r(i)):
    likelihood of being at or above speed x_d; components are likelihood of
    traveling that speed and expectation of discount
  - Pr(X_i = x > x_d|i,j) = F_r(i)(x)*(1 - P_j(x, r(i))):
    likelihood of traveling that speed above discount speed and not being
    discounted
  - discrimination: P_j(x, r(i) == "w") > P(x, r(i) == "m")
concerns:
  - Figure 4-7: (p14 read) (p45 graphs), officers don't stop different
    proportions of races
  - to what extent is more stringent ticketing due to higher risk, i.e. do
    minorities speed more often than whites
  - do lenient and non-lenient officers issue the same number of speeding tickets?
  - are time and geography predictive of getting a lenient officer?
  - are the officers incentivised to issue tickets?
  - don't see the stops that result in warnings/no ticket
  - taste-based vs statistical discrimination (i.e. are whites less likely to
    show up in court?)
  - are officers consistent in lenience over geographic area?
follow up:
  - "conditional on location and time, driver characteristics are not
    predictive of the average lenience of the officer they encounter"?
